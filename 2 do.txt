why dont we get species in thermo SA? try different observable
also, we dont get PDEp SA - we did get network 36, but its not reported in the log?

add the species in the sensitive reaction




*
fix the log so that its consisten: the same for 1st and 2nd runs


*
wrap up for Rafael presentation (compute rate? flux diagram? show PDep net 36?)


*
commit branch and see tests





other:
run GCN & autotst & Kinbot as queue jobs



removed from atlas3 when created TS_improvements:

Tests: checks ts do_other_bonds_change_more()
Added checks ts do_other_bonds_change_more()
Tests: Replaced ts checks determine_changing_bond > check_bond_changes()
Changed ts checks determine_changing_bonds() to check_bond_changes()





Normal mode displacement - fix and test for many cases
