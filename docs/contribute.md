# Contribute

We use T3 to facilitate our research and have made it available
as a benefit to the community in the hopes that others may find it useful as well.

We welcome contributions from the community.
Please see the
<a href="https://github.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/T3/wiki/Contributor-Guidelines" target="_blank">
contributor guidelines</a>
on T3's GitHub page, as well as the
<a href="https://github.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/T3/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md" target="_blank">
Code of Conduct</a>.

It is recommended to first open an issue on GitHub,
notifying the developers on a bug you are trying to fix
or a feature you plan to implement (see our
<a href="https://github.com/ReactionMechanismGenerator/T3/wiki/Roadmap" target="_blank">road map</a>)
to avoid duplicate work.
